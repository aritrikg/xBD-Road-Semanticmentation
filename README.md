## Overview

This project implements a semantic segmentation model that accurately detects road regions using the **xBD dataset**.  
It is built with deep learning frameworks such as **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**, and uses a range of preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to improve training performance.

## Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Covers the full workflow from preprocessing to training, evaluation, and inference  
- **Modular Design:** Each component (data loader, model, training script, etc.) is independent and easy to extend  
- **User-Friendly Configuration:** Manage hyperparameters and paths using configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`)  
- **GPU Acceleration:** Supports CUDA for faster model training  

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- PyTorch (or your preferred deep learning framework)  
- CUDA (for GPU support)  
- Additional libraries: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `albumentations`, `matplotlib`, etc.  
  *(See `requirements.txt` for details)*
